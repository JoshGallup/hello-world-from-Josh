Test repository to get use to using the various features of GIT Hub

I am a rising junior as Ohio State studying eletcircal engineering. When it comes to coding I have experience with C++, as well as some python, matlab, and VHDL. I am hoping to learn more about creating scripts, as well as creating code for a drone to use as opposed to just performing calculations or basic programs.
